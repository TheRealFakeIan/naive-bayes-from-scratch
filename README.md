# Naive Bayes Model from Scratch

## Project Overview 

This repository contains a ground up implementation of a Naïve Bayes model to predict the academic grades of high school students, built without the use of built in methods from libraries such as keras or scikit-learn. 

This restriction is enforced to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the mathematical background of the Naïve Bayes model.

A direct implementation using scikit-learn was included to verify the model's performance.


## Compatibility

The libraries needed in this project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook, specifically:

Python: 3.7.5
Scikit-learn: 0.22
