    "## Questions (you may respond in a cell or cells below):\n",
    "\n",
    "You should respond to Question 1 and two additional questions of your choice. A response to a question should take about 100–250 words, and make reference to the data wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Naive Bayes Concepts and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- a Explain the ‘naive’ assumption underlying Naive Bayes. (1) Why is it necessary? (2) Why can it be problematic? Link your discussion to the features of the students data set. [no programming required]\n",
    "- b Implement the required functions to load the student dataset, and estimate a Naive Bayes model. Evaluate the resulting classifier using the hold-out strategy, and measure its performance using accuracy.\n",
    "- c What accuracy does your classifier achieve? Manually inspect a few instances for which your classifier made correct predictions, and some for which it predicted incorrectly, and discuss any patterns you can find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: A Closer Look at Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- a You learnt in the lectures that precision, recall and f-1 measure can provide a more holistic and realistic picture of the classifier performance. (i) Explain the intuition behind accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure, (ii) contrast their utility, and (iii) discuss the difference between micro and macro averaging in the context of the data set. [no programming required]\n",
    "- b Compute precision, recall and f-1 measure of your model’s predictions on the test data set (1) separately for each class, and (2) as a single number using macro-averaging. Compare the results against your accuracy scores from Question 1. In the context of the student dataset, and your response to question 2a analyze the additional knowledge you gained about your classifier performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Training Strategies \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other evaluation strategies, which tend to be preferred over the hold-out strategy you implemented in Question 1.\n",
    "- a Select one such strategy, (i) describe how it works, and (ii) explain why it is preferable over hold-out evaluation. [no programming required]\n",
    "- b Implement your chosen strategy from Question 3a, and report the accuracy score(s) of your classifier under this strategy. Compare your outcomes against your accuracy score in Question 1, and explain your observations in the context of your response to question 3a.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand whether a machine learning model is performing satisfactorily we typically compare its performance against alternative models. \n",
    "- a Choose one (simple) comparison model, explain (i) the workings of your chosen model, and (ii) why you chose this particular model. \n",
    "- b Implement your model of choice. How does the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier compare against your additional model? Explain your observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Bias and Fairness in Student Success Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "As machine learning practitioners, we should be aware of possible ethical considerations around the\n",
    "applications we develop. The classifier you developed in this assignment could for example be used\n",
    "to classify college applicants into admitted vs not-admitted – depending on their predicted\n",
    "grade.\n",
    "- a Discuss ethical problems which might arise in this application and lead to unfair treatment of the applicants. Link your discussion to the set of features provided in the students data set. [no programming required]\n",
    "- b Select ethically problematic features from the data set and remove them from the data set. Use your own judgment (there is no right or wrong), and document your decisions. Train your Naive Bayes classifier on the resulting data set containing only ‘unproblematic’ features. How does the performance change in comparison to the full classifier?\n",
    "- c The approach to fairness we have adopted is called “fairness through unawareness” – we simply deleted any questionable features from our data. Removing all problematic features does not guarantee a fair classifier. Can you think of reasons why removing problematic features is not enough? [no programming required]\n"

    "#It performs well in small data sets, and scales well with additional features, classes and data sizes. \n",
    "#It is necessary to make our computations cheap and to make predictions in real time. \n",
